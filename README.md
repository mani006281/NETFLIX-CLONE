# NETFLIX-CLONE

I built a fully responsive Netflix Clone as part of my internship at SystemTron, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project starts with a login page where users enter their email and password. Upon successful login, it transitions to a homepage that closely resembles Netflix's interface, featuring a navigation bar, hero banner, and a trending section with scrollable movie posters and hover effects. It uses custom styling, DOM manipulation, and media queries to ensure responsiveness. Though it lacks backend functionality, this project helped me strengthen my frontend development skills and better understand real-world UI/UX practices.
